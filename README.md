# Applied Linear Models: Regression - Taught by Dr. Linlin Chen at Rochester Institute of Technology

I enrolled in this course during my second semester at RIT from August 2023 to December 2023. I wanted to have a solid foundation in statistics, which I believe I achieved through this course (along with Applied Statistics - taught by Professor Robert Parody - which did not have much a coding element). In addition to laying a solid foundation of statistics, I also learned a fair amount of coding in R, as shown in this repository. The textbook used for this course was [*Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis*, 5th ed., Douglas C. Montgomery, Elizabeth A. Peck, G. Geoffrey Vining (2006), Wiley](https://ocd.lcwu.edu.pk/cfiles/Statistics/Stat-503/IntroductiontoLinearRegressionAnalysisbyDouglasC.MontgomeryElizabethA.PeckG.GeoffreyViningz-lib.org.pdf). The problems in the homework assignments come from this book.
