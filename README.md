# Applied Linear Models: Regression - Taught by Dr. Linlin Chen at Rochester Institute of Technology

I enrolled in this course during my second semester at RIT from August 2023 to December 2023. I wanted to have a solid foundation in statistics, which I believe I achieved through this course (along with Applied Statistics - taught by Professor Robert Parody - which did not have much of a coding element). In addition to laying a solid foundation of statistics, I also learned a fair amount of coding in R, as shown in this repository. 

## [Project](Project/LongToralesProject.r)

1. Choose a topic with at least two quantitative variables. [I chose to work with environmental data about cyanobacteria](https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=https://doi.org/10.23719/1503175). I also chose to [work with this data](../VisualAnalytics/FinalProject) in my first semester in my [visual analytics course](../VisualAnalytics).

2. Using R:
    - Describe your data.
    - Perform a statistical analysis.
    - Check the validity of your model.

## Homework

The textbook used for this course was [*Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis*, 5th ed., Douglas C. Montgomery, Elizabeth A. Peck, G. Geoffrey Vining (2006), Wiley](https://ocd.lcwu.edu.pk/cfiles/Statistics/Stat-503/IntroductiontoLinearRegressionAnalysisbyDouglasC.MontgomeryElizabethA.PeckG.GeoffreyViningz-lib.org.pdf). The problems in the homework assignments labelled #.## (e.g. 2.1 is the first problem in Homework 1) come from this book. The homework problems that don't follow this structure do not come from the book, but their specifics will not be provided as this repository is NOT intended to be searchable for future students taking the course.
